<p>Ideally, computer users should evaluate the risks from the software they use. Many computers are sold with software already loaded. Whether installed by a computer manufacturer, operating system maker, Internet service provider, or by a retail store, the first step in assessing the vulnerability of your computer is to find out what software is installed and how programs will interact with each other. Unfortunately, it is not practical for most people to perform this level of analysis.</p>
